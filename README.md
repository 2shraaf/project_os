# project_os
- `Team 48`  :sunglasses:
- Link L-submission  [Submit](https://podio.com/webforms/14899154/999005).

##Branching?
- Create a branch for every task then merge it with master

##Where to work?
-M1/kernel.c
-M1/kernel.asm (I know the M1 name is misleading, my bad)
-Everything is set up there so it's better just to work there instead of setting up a whole new
environment.

Have fun! :man_with_turban:
